# Visual Studio Code Calculate

## About 
This extension is based on [Colinta's excellent Sublime Text Calculate package](https://github.com/colinta/SublimeCalculate) which has been a great tool for years.

This extension uses [Math.js](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs) for evaluating expressions. If it works there, it should work here!

## How to use
1. Select an expression in your document. For example, ((((5*5)+1)/2)-10)^2
2. Enter the Command Pallette (F1), and type "calculate"
3. The evaluated result will appear after your selection.

Especially useful with multiple cursors
